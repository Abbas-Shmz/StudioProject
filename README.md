# StudioProject
Studio (**St**reet **U**sers **Di**rect **O**bservation) is an ongoing PhD project at Polytechnique Montréal developed under supervision of [Prof. Nicolas Saunier](http://n.saunier.free.fr/saunier/) and [Dr. Owen Waygood](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/waygood-owen) to clean, validate, and analyze the trajectory of street users extracted by [TrafficIntelligence](https://trafficintelligence.confins.net) (TI).
TI is an open-source video analysis project developed at Polytechnique Montréal to track and identify street users applying video analytics.

StudioProject provides a suit of tools to evaluate a list of indicators pertaining to different functions of streets namely: transit, access and place.

Although the StudioProject is mainly developed to manipulate and analyze the output trajectories of TI, it also provides tools to collect data manually by reviewing video files.
